    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Punishment for crime has many [philosophical justifications](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/punishment/#ThePun).  An important one is that fear of punishment may *deter* people from committing crimes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the United States, some jurisdictions execute some people who are convicted of particularly serious crimes, such as murder.  This punishment is called the *death penalty* or *capital punishment*.  The death penalty is controversial, and deterrence has been one focal point of the debate.  There are other reasons to support or oppose the death penalty, but in this project we'll focus on deterrence.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key question about deterrence is: Does instituting a death penalty as a punishment for murder actually reduce the number of murders?\n",
    "\n",
    "You might have a strong intuition in one direction, but the evidence turns out to be surprisingly complex.  Different sides have variously argued that the death penalty has no deterrent effect and that each execution prevents 8 murders, all using statistical arguments!  We'll try to come to our own conclusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a road map for part 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In section 1, we'll visualize and explore the main dataset we'll be using.\n",
    "2. In section 2, we'll test a hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The main data source for this project comes from a [paper](http://cjlf.org/deathpenalty/DezRubShepDeterFinal.pdf) by three researchers, Dezhbakhsh, Rubin, and Shepherd.  The dataset contains rates of various violent crimes for every year 1960-2003 (44 years) in every US state.  The researchers compiled the data from the FBI's Uniform Crime Reports.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since crimes are committed by people, not states, we need to account for the number of people in each state when we're looking at state-level data.  Murder rates are calculated as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{murder rate for state X in year Y} = \\frac{\\text{number of murders in state X in year Y}}{\\text{population in state X in year Y}}*100000$$\n",
    "\n",
    "(Murder is rare, so we multiply by 100,000 just to avoid dealing with tiny numbers.)"

    "**Question 2.1.** <br/>Implement the function `two_year_changes` that takes an array of murder rates for a state, ordered by increasing year. For all two-year periods (e.g., from 1960 to 1962), it computes and returns **the number of increases minus the number of decreases.**\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the array `r = make_array(10, 7, 12, 9, 13, 9, 11)` contains 3 increases (10 to 12, 7 to 9, and 12 to 13), 1 decrease (13 to 11), and 1 change that is neither an increase or decrease (9 to 9). Therefore, `two_year_changes(r)` would return 2, the difference between 3 increases and 1 decrease.\n",

    "*Hint*: Consider using the `diff_n` function."
