    "Data science is a discipline that combines math, computer science, and domain expertise to work with data.  Some of the major areas of emphasis are data visualization and observing patterns in data.  Based on these patterns data scientists can make inferences about what is going on in the data, that is, what is causing the patterns.  Next the data scientists can try to make predictions based on the underlying models developed from the patterns in the data, for example employing regression or ther machine learning techniques.\n",

The models of behavior and what constitues indications and warnings are themselves built using data science techniques."
